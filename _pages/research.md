My research investigates sound change and sound patterns in Mandarin Chinese, especially the phenomenon of retroflex suffixation and rime merger. I am particularly interested in:

- Acoustic and auditory evidence of incomplete neutralisation
- The phonetics-phonology interface
- Empirical methods (e.g. Praat, R, GAMMs)
- Language contact and variation in Beijing Mandarin

Ongoing work includes GAMM-based analysis of spectral and tonal features in suffixation, and perceptual studies of tone realisation under prosodic and morphological influence.
