I am a PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge, based in the Phonetics and Phonology Lab. My research focuses on acoustic phonetics, incomplete contrast neutralisation, and the phonetics-phonology interface.

I hold an MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics from Cambridge (Darwin College), and a BA in Linguistics from the University of Manchester. I am passionate about sound systems, research communication, and empirical methods in phonetics.
