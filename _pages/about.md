Hello!

I’m **Yutong (Felicia) Wang**, a PhD student in *Theoretical and Applied Linguistics* at the **Phonetics & Phonology Lab, University of Cambridge**, supervised by Prof. Brechtje Post and Dr. Mitko Sabev (Saarland). My research investigates how morphophonological processes shape phonetic realisations in Beijing Mandarin, with interests in:

- **Acoustic phonetics**
- **Rime merger** and **retroflex suffixation**
- **Incomplete contrast neutralisation**
- The **phonetics–phonology interface**

## Academic Background

- **PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics**, Jesus College, University of Cambridge (present)  
- **MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics (Distinction)**, Darwin College, University of Cambridge (2022)  
  – Dissertation: *On the Nature of Beijing Retroflex Suffixation: An Acoustic Study*, supervised by Dr Mitko Sabev 
- **BA in Linguistics (First Class Honours)**, University of Manchester (2021)  
  – Dissertation: *Cues in Mandarin Tone Perception by Human Listeners and Automatic Recognisers*, supervised by Dr Wendell Kimper

## Current Research

My work explores how rime merger in Beijing Mandarin interacts with tonal processes under retroflex suffixation. Using acoustic and statistical methods, I analyse:

- Spectral and temporal properties of rime changes
- Tonal shifts under morphological conditioning
- Perceptual correlates of incomplete neutralisation

## Teaching

I supervise undergraduate papers:

- **Li1 (Sounds and Words)** – 2024, 2025  
- **Li6 (Phonetics)** – 2025  

Previously, I also tutored for:

- **Jesus College Winter Programme** - 2024, 2025

Topics I’ve taught include:  
IPA transcription • Speech acoustics • Mandarin phonetics • Research presentation skills

## Beyond the Lab

- Editor, *Cambridge Occasional Papers in Linguistics* (2025–)  
- Seminar Coordinator, Phonetics & Phonology Seminar Series (2024)  
- Faculty/University Open Day Lab Demonstrator (2024. 2025)

Outside academia, I enjoy running, good coffee, mixology, and support from my fluffy research assistants. Cho-Mee's one of them.
