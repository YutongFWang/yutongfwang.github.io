I am a PhD student in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge, based in the Phonetics and Phonology Lab. My research focuses on acoustic phonetics, incomplete contrast neutralisation, and the phonetics-phonology interface. 

Prior to starting my PhD, I obtained BA (Hons) in Linguistics at the University of Manchester and MPhil in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics at the University of Cambridge.
